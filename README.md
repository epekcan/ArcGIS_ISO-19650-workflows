# ArcGIS_ISO-19650-workflows

This repository is the resulted work for my thesis on the topic _**The role of Web GIS in project information management aligned with ISO 19650 standards**_. 
The created functionalities can be utilized to support information workflows aligned with ISO 19650 standards in ArcGIS platform.
Therefore, the Group feature is seen as a single ISO 19650 CDE in which items are considered information containers. The workflow are tested in ArcGIS Online, however, they should be fully functional in ArcGIS Enterprise
